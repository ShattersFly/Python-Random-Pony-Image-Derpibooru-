# Random-Pony-Image(Derpibooru)
Is a python script using sereral modules to fetch and send pony pictures from Derpibooru using windows notifications
It is designed to work on windows 10/11(and 7, though i didnt test it since i dont have nothing to test it on, but i tried)
For this to work windows notifications must be enabled in settings as well as in privacy settings

For those who dont want to work with python, there will be .exe version(compiled with Pyinstaller) in Releases page

# Customizing
You can customize a warping 2 settings: Time interval, Tags
On first run app will show where the config file is generated, there will be 2 lines contaning those 2 settings
interval_minutes - how much time in minutes next image will be sent
tags - tags that app will search for, it works same as search on derpibooru so make sure to search correct tags otherwise app will break
(also dont add anything unnessecary or it will also break)
